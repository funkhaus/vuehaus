## Common Tasks

### Getting Information from The Loop

Paste these anywhere in your `<script>` tags to use them in your own templates. This assumes you've included

```js
import _get from 'lodash/get'
```

All results from The Loop:

```js
_get(this.$store, 'state.loop')
```

The first result from The Loop:

```js
this.$store.getters.post
```

The featured image from the first result in The Loop:

```js
_get(this.$store.getters.post, 'featured_attachment')
```

The children of the first result of The Loop:

```js
_get(this.$store.getters.post, 'related.children')
```

### Loading Fonts

Vuehaus includes the Google/Typekit [Web Font Loader](https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader) in `parts/font-loader.php`. Follow the instructions on that repo to load fonts from Google, Typekit, or your own uploads.

```js
// font loader example
WebFontConfig = {
    google: {
        // your google fonts families here
        families: []
    },
    typekit: {
        id: ''
    },
    custom: {
        // your custom font families here
        families: [],
        urls: [
            '<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/static/fonts/fonts.css'
        ]
    }
}
```

### Using SVGs

1.  Place the .svg file in `src/svgs/`.
1.  In the `script` section of the template where you want to use the SVG, add:

    ```js
    import exampleSvg from 'src/svgs/example.svg'

    export default {
        data() {
            return {
                exampleSvg
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1.  In the location where you want to use the SVG:
    ```html
    <div v-html="exampleSvg"></div>
    ```
    That's it!

### Images

Vuehaus comes with a component called `responsive-image` that provides some built-in image handling, including fading in images as they load. You can pass an image object from Rest-Easy's attachment serializer and it will build itself automatically:

```html
<!-- Build a responsive image component from the featured image of the first post in The Loop -->
<responsive-image :object="$store.state.loop[0].featured_attachment"/>
```

You can also include any of the following attributes:

```html
<responsive-image
    src="source-url"
    height="height in px"
    width="width in px"
    aspect="aspect ratio, as percent (ie '56' for 56%)"
    size="WordPress-defined size slug"
    color="background color of pre-loaded space"
    />
```

You must include either an `object` or a `src` parameter on a `responsive-image` element; all other values are optional.

### Images with Videos

All images in Vuehaus have an associated video URL (saved as a metafield called `custom_video_url`). You can access this in a serialized image in Vuex with `image.videoUrl`.

### Shared Styles

Vuehaus supports SCSS out of the box, and comes with a style vars file in `src/styles/_vars.scss` and the base styling for the entire site in `src/styles/_base.scss`.

You can import the vars file in any Vue template like this:

```vue
<style lang="scss">
@import 'src/styles/vars';

// Now you have access to the $vars!
</style>
```

Vuehaus also comes with a few suggested breakpoints in that same vars file - you can use them in a media query like this:

```sass
@media #{ $lt-phone } {
   // your styling
}
```

The default breakpoints (with `lt` for "less than" and `gt` for "greater than") are:

-   **`gt-cinema`** - `only screen and (min-width: 1800px)`
-   **`lt-desktop`** - `only screen and (max-width: 1100px)`
-   **`lt-phone`** - `only screen and (max-width: 750px)`
-   **`lt-phone-landscape`** - `only screen and (max-width: 750px) and (orientation: landscape)`

### The Developer Role and Developer IDs

Since URLs can easily change in the WordPress backend, Vuehaus includes a new WP role, Developer, that has access to a set of controls that other roles (even Administrator) can't see. One of these controls is for a page's "Developer ID" - an arbitrary value that can reliably identify a page.

The Developer ID is accessible via a post object's `custom_developer_id` property - for example, `$post->custom_developer_id`.

If we set the About page's Developer ID to `about`, then rewrite the relevant line in `add_routes_to_json` like the following:

```php
...
    // path_from_dev_id is a Vuehaus function that retrieves a page's relative path from its Developer ID
    path_from_dev_id('about')                         => 'About'
...
```

This will guarantee that the path to this page will always render the About template, even if the user changes that path later on.

### Developer Capabilities

The Developer role in Vuehaus has a few extra capabilities available:

#### Preventing deletion

Any missing page in the `add_routes_to_json` function (for example, if `get_page_by_dev_id('about')` didn't find any pages) would break the given route; a Developer can lock pages to prevent this type of bug. Check the "Prevent non-dev deletion" box in the Developer Meta screen to prevent other users from placing that page in the Trash accidentally.

#### Hiding the rich editor

Check the "Hide Rich Editor" box to prevent non-Developer users from using WordPress's rich editor. This can be helpful to maintain stricter controls over the template and class names in a page's content.

### Advanced Routing

Take a look at the [path-to-regexp documentation](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp) for examples of routing using regex capabilities.

The routing table in Vuehaus automatically converts a string-string key-value pair to a Vue route object:

```php
array(
    path_from_dev_id('my-developer-id') => 'MyComponentName'
)
```

...turns to:

```js
const router = new VueRouter({
    routes: [{ path: '/my-developer-id', component: 'MyComponentName.vue' }]
})
```

You can take advantage of the Vue router's more advanced capabilities, like [redirect/alias](https://router.vuejs.org/en/essentials/redirect-and-alias.html), [naming](https://router.vuejs.org/en/essentials/named-routes.html), and more by setting the value to an object:

```php
array(
    path_from_dev_id('your-developer-id') => array(
        // Redirect to a path - in this case, to the path of the first child
        'redirect'		=> get_child_of_dev_id_path('work')
    ),

    path_from_dev_id('your-developer0id', '/:medium*')		=> array(
        // Define a component and a name for the route
        'component'		=> 'WorkGrid',
        'name'			=> 'work-grid'
    ),

    path_from_dev_id('your-developer-id') => array(
        // Redirect to a named route
        'redirect'		=> array(
            'name':     => 'work-grid'
        )
    )
)
```

This isn't the limit of the routing table's capabilities - anything the Vue router can do, you can build in the `add_routes_to_json` function.

#### Front Page Children

When trying to get the children of the front page, you'll need to use `slug_from_dev_id` instead of `path_from_dev_id`:

```php
'/' . slug_from_dev_id('front-page') . '/:detail' => 'FrontPageChild',
```

`path_from_dev_id` would return a slash as the relative path to the front page, but `slug_from_dev_id` ensures that you're getting the front page's name.

### Utility Functions

Vuehaus defines a few utility functions to make building the routing table easier:

-   `get_child_of_dev_id($dev_id, $nth_child = 0)` - Get the post object of the nth child (zero-based, default `0`) of a page with the given Developer ID.
-   `get_child_of_dev_id_path($dev_id, $nth_child = 0, $after = '')` - Get the relative path of the nth child of a page with the given Developer ID. Adds `$after` to the retrieved path.
-   `get_children_of_dev_id($dev_id)` - Get the children of a page with the given Developer ID. Returns `false` if no page with Developer ID exists or an empty array if no children found.
-   `get_page_by_dev_id($dev_id)` - Get the first page with a given Developer ID. Returns the complete WP Post object or `false` if none found.
-   `path_from_dev_id($dev_id, $after = '')` - Get the relative path of a page with a given Developer ID. Adds `$after` to the retrieved path. Returns `'#404'` if no page with the given Developer ID is found.
-   `slug_from_dev_id($dev_id)` - Get the slug of a page with a given Developer ID.
-   `user_is_developer()` - Boolean indicating whether the current logged-in user is a Developer or not.

### Upgrading Plugins

If you need to upgrade your version of [Rest-Easy](https://github.com/funkhaus/Rest-Easy), change the `$latest_rest_easy` variable in `functions/vuehaus-plugins.php` to match the latest Rest Easy version. You'll be prompted to upgrade the next time you load any page on the WordPress backend.

## Vuex and State

Vuehaus uses [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/intro.html) to handle a site's state. The default store in `src/utils/store.js` is set up like this:

```js
{
    // From Rest-Easy
    site: jsonData.site,
    meta: jsonData.meta,
    loop: jsonData.loop,

    // Vuehaus-specific
    transitioning_in: false,
    transitioning_out: false,
    loaded: true
}
```

See the [Rest-Easy documentation](https://github.com/funkhaus/rest-easy) for more information on `jsonData` and its properties, as well as the [Vuex documentation](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/intro.html) for Vuex terms like store, state, mutation, etc.

### Mutations

You can commit a mutation from any Vue component by using:

```js
this.$store.commit('MUTATION_NAME', payload)
```

Default Vuehaus mutations:

-   `'REPLACE_QUERYDATA', { site, meta, loop }` - Replaces the `store`'s `site`, `meta`, and `loop` properties with the `site`, `meta`, and `loop` properties of the payload.
-   `'SET_TRANSITIONING_IN, true | false'` - Sets `state.transitioning_in` to the given value.
-   `'SET_TRANSITIONING_OUT, true | false'` - Sets `state.transitioning_out` to the given value.
-   `'SET_LOADED', true | false` - Sets `state.loaded` to the given value.
-   `'OPEN_MENU'` - Sets `state.menuOpened` to `true`.
-   `'CLOSE_MENU'` - Sets `state.menuOpened` to `false`.
-   `'UPDATE_REFERRAL_ROUTE'` - Sets `state.referral` to given referral object.

### Actions

Where mutations are synchronous, actions are asynchronous:

```js
this.$store.dispatch('ACTION_NAME', payload)
```

Default Vuehaus actions:

-   `'LOAD_AND_REPLACE_QUERYDATA, { path: 'url string' }'` - Runs the following process:
    1.  Sets `state.loaded` to `false`.
    1.  Checks `src/utils/cache.js` (which is a global cache that can be `import`ed into any other file) for the given `path` key.
        If none is found:
        1.  Commits `'SET_LOADED', false`
        1.  Fetches the data from the the URL at the payload path.
        1.  Saves the data to the cache.
    1.  Commits `'REPLACE_QUERYDATA'` with the data from the cache.
    1.  Commits `'SET_LOADED', true`

### Getters

Getters are shortcuts to dynamic state properties:

`$store.state.getters.desiredGetter`

Default Vuehaus getters include:

-   `loading` - Returns the opposite of `$store.state.loaded`.
-   `post` - Returns either the first post in `$store.state.loop` or, if none, an empty object.
-   `referralPath` - Returns either the `fullPath` of the current value of `$store.state.referral` or, if none, an empty string.

## Vuehaus Events

Throttled resize and scroll events are available to any child of the App component:

```js
this.$root.$on('throttled.resize', () => {
    // your throttled resize event here...
    // default: 1 per 10ms
})
this.$root.$on('throttled.scroll', () => {
    // your throttled scroll event here...
    // default: 1 per 10ms
})
```

Both events are fired after the `$root` element saves updated window dimensions/scroll positions for resize/scroll events.

## Partials

Vuehaus comes with a few SCSS [partials](http://sass-lang.com/guide) to make writing CSS easier. In a Vue template file:

```
<style lang="scss">

    @import 'src/styles/desired-partial';

</style>
```

Default partials include:

-   `base` - Style applied in `App.vue`, affecting every page on the site.
-   `easings` - Several common easing functions. Includes:

    -   easeIn, easeOut, and easeInOut for:
        -   Sine
        -   Quad
        -   Cubic
        -   Quart
        -   Quint
        -   Expo
        -   Circ
        -   Back
        -   Fast
    -   authenticMotion

-   `transitions` - Common transitions applied in `App.vue`, affecting every page on the site. Includes:

    -   `fade`
    -   `slide-left`
    -   `slide-right`

    Usable with:

    `<transition name="transition-name"><your-code-here/></transition>`

-   `vars` - Variables to use across the site. Import in any given template to make global CSS changes much easier to manage. Defaults include:

    -   `$white: #ffffff;`
    -   `$black: #000000;`
    -   `$font-family: 'Helvetica';`
    -   `$desktop-padding: 50px;`
    -   `$mobile-padding: 20px;`
    -   `$header-height: 80px;`

    The following are breakpoints that can be used with `@media #{$size} { /* your rules here */ }`:

    -   `$gt-cinema: "only screen and (min-width: 1800px)";`
    -   `$lt-desktop: "only screen and (max-width: 1100px)";`
    -   `$lt-phone: "only screen and (max-width: 750px)";`
    -   `$lt-phone-landscape: "only screen and (max-width: 750px) and (orientation: landscape)";`

    `vars` includes the following mixins:

    -   `fill` - `position: absolute` with `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` set to `0`.
    -   `cover` - Centered, no-repeat, `background-size: cover`.
    -   `contain` - Same as `cover`, but with `background-size: contain`.

## Gutenberg Blocks

Vuehaus comes with [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/) support out of the box, including a simple way to create and use your own custom blocks.

TL;DR:

-   Run npm run block-dev for development
-   Add blocks in blocks/src/index.js
-   Run npm run block-build to build blocks for production
-   Use gutenberg-content instead of wp-content to render content

### Adding a Block

To add a new block:

-   Call `buildBlock` in `blocks/src/index.js`
-   Run `npm run block-dev` for development and `npm run block-build` for production.

The simplest example is creating a new text block:

```js
buildBlock({
    // The unique slug of your block (namespaced to your theme) (required)
    slug: 'text-block',

    // Class applied to the block (required)
    class: 'text-block',

    // The human-readable name of your block (optional)
    name: 'Text Block',

    // A short block description (optional)
    description: 'A block of text.',

    // WP Dash Icon (https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/) (optional)
    icon: 'format-gallery',

    // The block content (required)
    content: [
        {
            // Unique name for this item
            name: 'myContent',
            // Item type - 'text'
            type: 'text'
        }
    ]
})
```

When you've added a new block, it will appear under your theme name in the block menu when editing a Gutenberg post.

### Block Content

`content` is an array that contains 1 or more objects with a name and a type:

```js
content: [
    { name: 'firstWord', type: 'text' },
    { name: 'middleWord', type: 'text' },
    { name: 'lastWord', type: 'text' }
]
```

You can also include [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) in your content:

```js
content: [
    <h2>Enter Your Headline Here:</h2>,
    { name: 'headline', type: 'text' },
    <h2>Enter Your Content Here:</h2>,
    { name: 'body', type: 'text' }
]
```

### Block Content Types

You can use any of the following as the `type` parameter in block content:

-   `text`
-   `image`

#### Adding Content Types

To add a new content type:

1. Create a new JS file in `blocks/src/prebuilt`.
1. Export an object containing `attributes`, `edit`, and `save` from this file.
    1. You can use `blocks/src/prebuilt/text.js` as a model for each property, all of which are required to save and render content correctly.
1. Import the result into `blocks/src/prebuilt/index.js`. Export this value with the name of the type as the key.
    1. Example: `text.js` is imported to the index file, then exported with the key `text`. Blocks wanting to use this type can do so by setting their `type` to `'text'`.

### Rendering Gutenberg Content

[fh-components](https://github.com/funkhaus/fh-components) comes with a `wp-content` component designed for rendering WordPress content, but we recommend using the built-in `gutenberg-content` component for Gutenberg pages.

It accepts all the same [arguments](https://github.com/funkhaus/fh-components#wp-content) as `wp-content`, but comes with extra `replace` values to handle images in content.

### Removing Block Support

If you don't want to support custom Gutenberg blocks and want to simplify your theme, you can:

1. Delete the `blocks/` directory
1. Delete `functions/blocks.php`
1. Remove this line from `functions.php`:

    `include_once get_template_directory() . '/functions/blocks.php';`

1. Remove this line from `package.json`'s `files` array:

    `"blocks/**/*.*",`

## Deploying

Vuehaus comes with [fh-deploy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fh-deploy) to make deploying your site as easy as possible.

Run `npm run deploy` to generate a config file based on a few user inputs. The queue of files to upload is in the package.json `files` property. `npm run deploy` automatically uploads whatever you have in your directory at the time to your server, so we recommend running `npm run build` first - a full deploy command might look like this:

`npm run build && npm run deploy`

**Important note from fh-deploy readme:**

Running fh-deploy will automatically overwrite any files of the same name on your server WITHOUT prompting. **Assume your remote files are going to be overwritten as soon as you run fh-deploy and make sure you keep up-to-date backups!**

## Contributing

Thanks for your interest in working on Vuehaus! You can start any way you'd like, but here's how the Funkhaus team does it:

1. Install [Local by Flywheel](https://local.getflywheel.com/) to quickly spin up new local WordPress sites.
1. Create a new WordPress site in Local. We'll call ours "Vuehaus" as an example.
1. Clone this repo into the `wp-content/themes` folder on the new site. On OSX, that'd look like this:

    ```sh
    cd ~/Local\ Sites/vuehaus/app/public/wp-content/themes
    git clone https://github.com/funkhaus/vuehaus
    ```

1. Activate the Vuehaus theme in the WordPress backend.
1. Open the repo in your editor of choice and run (optionally using [LiveReload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/livereload)):

    ```sh
    npm install

    # watch development build, or...
    npm run dev

    # ...use livereload for a more seamless experience
    livereload . & npm run dev
    ```

1. When you're ready to submit, `npm run build` to make sure the build compiles correctly, then submit your pull request!

#### Developing for `fh-components`

If you're developing for [fh-components](https://github.com/funkhaus/fh-components) as well, we recommend using `npm link`:

```sh
# Clone the fh-components repo in a shared location
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/funkhaus/fh-components

# Make this new fh-components clone the definitive version
cd fh-components
npm link

# Head to the Vuehaus theme installation
cd ~/Local\ Sites/vuehaus/app/public/wp-content/themes/vuehaus
# Uninstall the local fh-components instance and instead use the cloned version above
npm uninstall fh-components
npm link fh-components
```

From here, running `npm run dev` on both `fh-components` and the Vuehaus theme will reflect changes in `fh-components`. (You can edit the `src/views/Default.vue` template to test out new components.)

When you're done making changes and have published the new `fh-components`:

```sh
cd ~/Local\ Sites/vuehaus/app/public/wp-content/themes/vuehaus

# unlink the local version
npm uninstall fh-components
# make sure fh-components is installed in package.json
npm install fh-components
```
